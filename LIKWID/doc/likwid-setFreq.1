.B likwid-setFrequencies(1)
that performs the actual setting of hardware thread's frequency and governor.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B likwid-setFreq

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B No options

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B likwid-setFreq
is a command line application that mediates the request from
.B likwid-setFrequencies(1)
because setting a hardware thread's frequency and/or governor requires root privileges. When starting the daemon,
it opens a UNIX socket and waits for connects from LIKWID. When the connection is established, the library
can send commands to
.B likwid-setFreq
. The daemon is just used to change the sysfs files, the library accesses the files itself for reading
to minimize overhead. This executable must be suid-root.
.B likwid-setFreq
works with the 'acpu_cpufreq' and the 'intel_pstate' driver.
