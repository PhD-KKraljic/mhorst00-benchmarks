<H2>General-purpose counters</H2>
<P>The IBM&reg; POWER8 microarchitecture provides 4 general-purpose counters consisting of a config and a counter register. Additionally, there are two registers marked as general-purpose but they are fixed to specific events (like the fixed-purpose counters of Intel&reg; systems). Be aware that IBM names the counters PMC1-PMC6 while LIKWID uses PMC0-PMC5. Events like PM_PMCx_OVERFLOW are adapted accordingly.</P>
